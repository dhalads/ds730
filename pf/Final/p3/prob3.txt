Problem 3

a. Where you obtained your data. A link to the data is sufficient. Please do
not upload many GBâ€™s of data to the dropbox.

    Weather data from https://registry.opendata.aws/noaa-gsod/
    Downloaded using - aws s3 cp s3://aws-gsod/2011/725060-94728.csv . --no-sign-request
    Chose the data from 2011 because is was complete for each day. I would have liked to get hourly data versus daily data.
    The data file is for a weather station located in central park, New York City.

    Taxi trip data from https://registry.opendata.aws/nyc-tlc-trip-records-pds/
    Downloaded using aws - s3 cp s3:"//nyc-tlc/trip data/yellow_tripdata_2011-06.csv" . --no-sign-request
    Chose this dataset because it is large, 2.6GB per month of in 2011. Chose 2011 data because the weather data was complete for that year.


b. The questions that you asked of your data in a reasonable format (e.g. a
Word document).

    How is NY taxi usage different between days it rains and days that does not rain?

    trips/day
    mean passenger count
    mean fare
    mean tip to fare ratio


c. The answers to the questions in a reasonable format.

    The answer below is for only one month of taxi data 2011-06
    +---------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
    |Rain_or_Drizzle|      tripsPerDay|          meanPass|          meanFare|       tipFareRatio|
    +---------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
    |              1|504487.2727272727|1.6618756036732163|10.428642445255202|0.09558045416001584|
    |              0|489987.5263157895|1.6660656130558855|10.381674532423947|0.09365293207675451|
    +---------------+-----------------+------------------+------------------+-------------------+
    % change over days with no rain:
    tripsPerDay : 3
    meanPass : -0.25 
    meanFare : 0.39
    tipFareRatio : 2

    Conclusion: When it rains trips per day go up and tips go up.
