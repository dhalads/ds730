// Print out all words that appear between 5 and 7 times (including 5 and 7) in the wap.txt
// document. The words can appear in any order. Print out only the words and not the
// associated count. All words are separated by whitespace (spaces, tabs, newlines) only.
// All other characters belong to a word. For example, donâ€™t is a word and hello, is a word
// (note the comma) which is different from the word hello that might appear in the
// document. A word must contain at least 1 character (i.e. the empty string is ignored for
// all problems). The words should be case-insensitive: the and The are the same word.
